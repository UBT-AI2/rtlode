Synthesis with Quartus:

  RTL simulation and synthesis are driven by the same filelist.txt and
  underlying OPAE scripts.  To construct a Quartus synthesis environment
  for this AFU, enter:

    $ afu_synth_setup --source hw/rtl/filelist.txt build_synth
    $ cd build_synth
    $ ${OPAE_PLATFORM_ROOT}/bin/run.sh

  run.sh will invoke Quartus, which must be properly installed.  The end
  result will be a file named hello_afu.gbs in the build_synth directory.
  This GBS file may be loaded onto a compatible FPGA using OPAE's fpgaconf
  tool.

  To run the software:

    $ cd sw
    $ make clean
    $ make
    $ ./hello_afu
